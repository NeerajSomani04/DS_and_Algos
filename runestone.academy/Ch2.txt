Chapter 2 --> Analysis of Program in terms of Time and Space complexity

“Big-O” execution time of common operations on Python lists and dictionaries.
What Is Algorithm Analysis? Comparision of your program with Another and evalute whos program is better. 
Now the question is How to evaluate? 

1) Readability --> also known as Easily Maintainable.
2) On the other hand it can also be evaluated based upon the amount of computing resources that each algorithm uses.
