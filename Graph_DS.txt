Graph --> A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (Vertices) and edges (lines connecting nodes).
In other words, A Graph consists of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and set of Edges which connect a pair of nodes.

Example for a Graph, the set of vertices V = {0,1,2,3,4} and the set of edges E = {01, 12, 23, 34, 04, 14, 13}.

Graphs are used to represent networks. The networks may include paths in a city or telephone network or circuit network. 
Graphs are also used in social networks like linkedIn, Facebook. For example, in Facebook, each person is represented 
with a vertex(or node). Each node is a structure and contains information like person id, name, gender, locale etc.

Once again, Graph is a data structure that consists of following two components:
1. A finite set of vertices also called as nodes.
2. A finite set of ordered pair of the form (u, v) called as edge. The pair is ordered because (u, v) is not same as (v, u) in case of 
a directed graph(di-graph). The pair of the form (u, v) indicates that there is an edge from vertex u to vertex v. The edges may 
contain weight/value/cost.

A Graph, can be created using Array of LinkList, Array of Set, Array of Vectors, etc. Each category has some pros and cons, needs to understand that in detail. 

A set is different from a vector in two ways: it stores elements in a sorted way, and duplicate elements are not allowed. 
Therefore, this approach cannot be used for graphs containing parallel edges. Since sets are internally implemented as 
binary search trees, an edge between two vertices can be searched in O(logV) time, where V is the number of vertices in the graph.
