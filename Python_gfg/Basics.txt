Python Basics --> general-purpose, high level programming language (designed by Guido van Rossum - early 1990's & developed by Python Software Foundation.)
emphasis on code readability, and to express concepts in fewer lines of code.
two major Python versions- Python 2 and Python 3. Both are quite different.

Python need to have an interpreter to interpret and run programs.
Many Operating systems bundled python interpreter in itself. like Linux, Python comes bundled with the linux.
for windows you can install from http://python.org/
interpreters like https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/, http://ideone.com/ or http://codepad.org/ 

Programming basics with Python:
1. In Python comments begin with #. { example,  [# Script Begins]  }
# is used for single line comment in Python
""" this is a comment """ is used for multi line comments.

2. to print something on the console print() function is used. 
example, 
print(“GeeksQuiz”)  # python 3 version syntax
print "Hello, world!" # python 2 version syntax
---> One difference between Python 2 and Python 3 is the print statement. In Python 2, the “print” statement is not a function, and therefore can be invoked without a parenthesis. However, in Python 3, it is a function, and must be invoked with parentheses.

Python 3 basics --> Python 3.0 was released in 2008. It is interpreted language i.e its not compiled and the interpreter will check the code line by line.
Note: Please note that Python for its scope doesn’t depend on the braces ( { } ), instead it uses indentation for its scope.

--> in Python you don’t need to declare the type of variables. Just type in the variable and when values will be given to it, then it will automatically know whether the value given would be a int, float or char or even a String.

--> Python has 4 types of built in Data Structures namely List, Dictionary, Tuple and Set.

--> List --> is mutable, means changable. (means, i.e items can be added to list later after the list creation.)
--> append() function is used to add data to the list.
--> Below you can see a same list can hold different data types of items.

below is sample program --> 
# creates a empty list 
nums = []  
  
# appending data in list 
nums.append(21) 
nums.append(40.5) 
nums.append("String") 
  
print(nums) 

--> input() function is used to take input from the user through console.
--> print() function is used to print output to user on the console.

---> Selection in Python is made using the two keywords ‘if’ and ‘elif’ and else (elseif). Below is sample code for same.

# Python program to illustrate 
# selection statement 
  
num1 = 34
if(num1>12): 
    print("Num1 is good") 
elif(num1>35): 
    print("Num2 is not gooooo....") 
else: 
    print("Num2 is great") 

Functions ---> keyword ‘def’ is used to define a function. A functions is like a bunch of code that is intended to do a particular task.
Syntax: 
# functions 
def hello(): 
    print("hello") 
    print("hello again") 
  
# calling function 
hello()                


main function --> In python also, program starts from a ‘main’ function… below is a sample code with main function -->

def Main(): 
    print("Started") 
 
# now we are required to tell Python  
# for 'Main' function existence 
if __name__=="__main__": 
    Main() 
    
Iteration (Looping) --> the most popular ‘for’ loop here.    
# a simple for loop code 
for step in range(5):     
    print(step) 

Modules --> Python has a very rich module library that has several functions to do many tasks.
‘import’ keyword is used to import a particular module/library. 
example:
# math module 
import math 
  
def Main(): 
    num = float(input("Enter a number: ")) 
    # fabs is used to get the absolute value of a decimal 
    num = math.fabs(num)  
    print(num) 
if __name__=="__main__": 
    Main() 

--> Python – The new generation Language -->
Reason for increasing popularity ---- Philosophy is “Simplicity is the best”.

--> Emphasis on code readability, shorter codes, ease of writing, 
--> supports multiple programming paradigms, like object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural.
--> There exists inbuilt functions for almost all of the frequently used concepts.


LANGUAGE FEATURES --> 

Interpreted
There are no separate compilation and execution steps like C and C++.
Directly runthe program from the source code.
Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes which is then translated into native language of specific computer to run it.
No need to worry about linking and loading with libraries, etc.
Platform Independent
Python programs can be developed and executed on multiple operating system platforms.
Python can be used on Linux, Windows, Macintosh, Solaris and many more.
Free and Open Source; Redistributable
High-level Language
In Python, no need to take care about low-level details such as managing the memory used by the program.
Simple
Closer to English language;Easy to Learn
More emphasis on the solution to the problem rather than the syntax
Embeddable
Python can be used within C/C++ program to give scripting capabilities for the program’s users.
Robust:
Exceptional handling features
Memory management techniques in built
Rich Library Support
The Python Standard Library is vary vast.
Known as the “batteries included” philosophy of Python ;It can help do various things involving regular expressions, documentation generation, unit testing, threading, databases, web browsers, CGI, email, XML, HTML, WAV files, cryptography, GUI and many more.
Besides the standard library, there are various other high-quality libraries such as the Python Imaging Library which is an amazingly simple image manipulation library.


Keywords in Python | Set 1 -->
--> True and False in python are same as 1 and 0. True == 1, False == 0
--> None : This is a special constant used to denote a null value or a void. Its important to remember, 0, any empty container(e.g empty list) do not compute to None.
It is an object of its own datatype – NoneType. It is not possible to create multiple None objects and can assign it to variables.
--> and : This a logical operator in python. “and” returns true if both the operands are true. Else returns false.
--> or : This a logical operator in python. “or” returns true if any one of the operand is true. 
--> not : This logical operator inverts the truth value.
7. assert : This function is used for debugging purposes. Usually used to check the correctness of code. If a statement evaluated to true, nothing happens, but when it is false, “AssertionError” is raised . One can also print a message with the error, separated by a comma.

8. break : “break” is used to control the flow of loop. The statement is used to break out of loop and passes the control to the statement following immediately after loop.

9. continue : “continue” is also used to control the flow of code. The keyword skips the current iteration of the loop, but does not end the loop.

10. Pass Statement: We use pass statement to write empty loops. Pass is also used for empty control statement, function and classes.  It is the null statement in python. Nothing happens when this is encountered. This is used to prevent indentation errors and used as a placeholder.

11. class : This keyword is used to declare user defined classes.
12.  del : del is used to delete a reference to an object. Any variable or list value can be deleted using del.
13. raise : Also used for exception handling to explicitly raise exceptions.

import : This statement is used to include a particular module into current program.

from : Generally used with import, from is used to import particular functionality from the module imported.

in : This keyword is used to check if a container contains a value. This keyword is also used to loop through the container.

is : This keyword is used to test object identity, i.e to check if both the objects take same memory location or not.
 
---> Print without newline in Python 3.x ---> also, depends on how you use it.
print("geeks", end =" ") 
print("geeksforgeeks") 
output: geeks geeksforgeeks
