What is the maximum possible value of an integer in Python ?
In Python, value of an integer is not restricted by the number of bits and can expand to the limit of the available memory

Global variable vs Local variable -->
global variable is defined outside of function. 
Local variable defined inside of function. 
If we want to use global variable and local variable with same name, then global variable, needs to be use with global keyword.

Packing and Unpacking Arguments in Python -->
We use two operators * (for tuples) and ** (for dictionaries).

---> end parameter in print() function --> 
By default python’s print() function ends with a newline.
how to print without newline, By default, the value of this parameter is ‘\n’, i.e. the new line character. You can end a print statement with any character/string using this parameter.
# ends the output with a <space>  
print("Welcome to" , end = ' ')  
print("GeeksforGeeks", end = ' ') 

Type Conversion in Python --> to convert values of one type to another
1. int(a,base) : This function converts any data type to integer. ‘Base’ specifies the base in which string is if data type is string.
2. float() : This function is used to convert any data type to a floating point number.
3. ord() : This function is used to convert a character to integer.
4. hex() : This function is to convert integer to hexadecimal string.
5. oct() : This function is to convert integer to octal string.
6. tuple() : This function is used to convert to a tuple.
7. set() : This function returns the type after converting to set.
8. list() : This function is used to convert any data type to a list type.
9. dict() : This function is used to convert a tuple of order (key,value) into a dictionary.

10. str() : Used to convert integer into a string.

11. complex(real,imag) : : This function converts real numbers to complex(real,imag) number.

Byte Objects vs String in Python --->
Byte objects are sequence of Bytes, whereas Strings are sequence of characters.
Byte objects are in machine readable form internally, Strings are only in human readable form.
Since Byte objects are machine readable, they can be directly stored on the disk. Whereas, Strings need encoding before which they can be stored on disk.

Converting Strings to byte objects is termed as encoding. 
This is necessary so that the text can be stored on disk using mapping using ASCII or UTF-8 encoding techniques.
encode() and decode() are the methods used to perform this tasks.

Python: In Python, there is a simple and syntactically neat construct to swap variables, we just need to write “x, y = y, x”.

Underscore (_) in Python
Following are different places where _ is used in Python:

Single Underscore:
In Interpreter --> _ returns the value of last executed expression value in Python Prompt/Interpreter
After a name --> this is used to avoid variable names same as python reserved keyword names.
Before a name
Double Underscore:
__leading_double_underscore
__before_after__
