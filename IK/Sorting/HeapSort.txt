Heap Sort -->

Its Left Complete Binary Tree
Heap Property --> Parent_value must be less than kid_value

Benefits --> Since it is left complete
1) Its Balanced --> then performace is Log (n)
2) Can be stored in array 

In this case we are assuming to start heap array index with 1.

hence, below are few key points:
1) valid (i) --> would always be in this scenario i <= size and i >= 1
2) left of i --> 2i index
3) right of i --> 2i + 1 index
4) parent of i --> i / 2 (only integer value of division)

Psudo-code for heap insert operation -->

void insert(v) {
  put the value in heap [size + 1]
  size++
  i = size
  while (i/2 >= 1 && heap property violeted between i and i/2){
    swap with parents
    }
