1 (Linear Data Structures) --> Array, Linked List, Stack and Queue

Array --> Array is a data structure used to store homogeneous elements at contiguous locations. Size of an array must be provided before storing data.
Let size of array be n.
Accessing Time: O(1) [This is possible because elements
                      are stored at contiguous locations]   
Search Time:   O(n) for Sequential Search: 
               O(log n) for Binary Search [If Array is sorted]
Insertion Time: O(n) [The worst case occurs when insertion 
                     happens at the Beginning of an array and 
                     requires shifting all of the elements]
Deletion Time: O(n) [The worst case occurs when deletion 
                     happens at the Beginning of an array and 
                     requires shifting all of the elements]
                     
Linked List --> each element is a separate object. Each element (that is node) of a list is comprising of two items â€“ the data and a reference to the next node.
