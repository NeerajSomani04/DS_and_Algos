2 (Binary Tree, BST, Heap and Hash) --> Hierarchical Data Structures

Binary Tree --> (implemented mainly using Links). Each node with two children, Left child and right child
Binary Tree Representation --> A tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node in tree. If the tree is empty, then value of root is NULL. 
A Binary Tree node contains following parts.
1. Data
2. Pointer to left child
3. Pointer to right child

A Binary Tree can be traversed in two ways:
Depth First Traversal: Inorder (Left-Root-Right), Preorder (Root-Left-Right) and Postorder (Left-Right-Root)
Breadth First Traversal: Level Order Traversal

Binary Tree Properties:
Maximum number of nodes = 2h â€“ 1.
Here h is height of a tree. Height is considered as is maximum number of nodes on root to leaf path

Minimum possible height =  ceil(Log2(n+1))   

In Binary tree, number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.

Time Complexity of Tree Traversal: O(n)

Examples : tree in general is for the things that form a hierarchy. like, File structures. Another example, useful in storing heirarchical objects like JavaScript Document Object Model considers HTML page as a tree with nesting of tags as parent child relations.
