PCA (Principle component Analysis) -->

It helps in solving the issue of multi-colinearity and try to find the relationship between co-related predictors.

Dimesion Reduction --> When we convert a large number of predictors into small number of predictors, using some mathematical formula that doesn't change the importance of dimentions then it is known as dimension reduction. 

In PCA we are looking for the direction, in which there is greatest amount of variance happening.
steps -->
--> first you need to find the covariance matrix
--> then you find the eigen values and eigen matrix of those values.
Eigen vectors are ordered by the magnitude of corresponding eigen values "lambda".
