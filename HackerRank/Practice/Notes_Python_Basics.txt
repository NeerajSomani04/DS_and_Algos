python collections class -->

1. DefaultDict is similar to dictionary (dict), but with default values in the definition as well. If you didn't use a defaultdict you'd have to check to see if that key exists, and if it doesn't, set it to what you want. 

2. collections.Counter() 
A counter is a container that stores elements as dictionary keys, and their counts are stored as dictionary values.

from collections import Counter
